## Episode-1

### The Plan
Todays stream will be setting up a vm to do future streams in with the viwers a kind of walk along set up guide for basic development on linux mint or windows with a virtual machine.

If you are joining the stream day of you can fork/ clone this repo of instructions to follow along with me.

If you are finding my stream later this is the starting point for any future projects or streams the instructions are in the Stream Notes file.

## The REPO
- bashrc_template-- this is a copy of the bashrc file i create in my viedo.. it is the basic linux mint bashrc file but with a few additions such as NVM pathing and Auto compleate and text colors also has git information too.

- [Stream_content](./Stream_Content.md) -- this is a text version of my step by step walkthrough on how to set up Virtual Box a Linux mint os and some basic development tools.
